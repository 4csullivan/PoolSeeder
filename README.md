# PoolSeeder
## By Cameron Sullivan

PoolSeeder is a program that can automatically seed Challonge tournaments that are using pools.

## How to use

1) Launch the program.
2) Click on Edit->Setup if you have not yet.
3) Fill in necessary info:

> Username - Your account's username.
> API Key - Your account's developer API key.
> Subdomain - Fill this in with your community's subdomain only if using a community. Keep this unchecked if just a user.
	- EX: subdomain.challonge.com, NOT challonge.com/communities/subdomain.
	If your community does not have a set subdomain, a hidden,
	generated subdomain is located in the community's settings.

4) Hit save.
	- Once set, the settings do not need to be touched in the future.
	- Update only the sections you want to update. Blank sections will
	not override the previous sections.
5) Type in number of pools.
6) Hit Run.
